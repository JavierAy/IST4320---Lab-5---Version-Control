# IST4320---Lab-5---Version-Control
Here we are defining csusb as the variable, with it's two arguments. I went ahead and made it so that the values are 'schoolName' and 'schoolMascot'. 
I can share this script and it will function just the same from one student to the next, because every school has a name and a mascot. The second line
has the 'print' command that will output the school name, with a space, followed by the mascot of that school. The third line is blank on purpose, and the 
fourth line has finally provided a value to our script, in this case I put "CSU, San Bernardino" as the 'schoolName' argument, and "Coyote" as the 'schoolMascot' argument.
